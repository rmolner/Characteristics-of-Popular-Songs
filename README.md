## Characteristics-of-Popular-Songs
# LaunchCode 2023 Data Analysis Final Project
For my final class project I used this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-spotify-songs-from-20102019-by-year?select=top10s.csv
I wanted to explore the characteristics of the most popular songs to see how they trend and can be used to create popular songs.
